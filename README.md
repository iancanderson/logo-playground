## Stark Latin

This program translates a sentence into an imaginary language called "Stark
Latin".

After you load the [stark-latin.lg](stark-latin.lg) file into Logo, you can use it like this:

```
translate [good morning!]
```

In this case, the program will print out the sentence translated to Stark Latin:

```
oodgark orningmark!
```

### Bonus points

Try changing the `"ark` part of the program to a different suffix to create your
own secret language!
